2. The Monty Hall door problem is a fun statistical problem that we can simulate.
For those unfamiliar, the game is this. A player chooses between door 1, door 2
and door 3. Behind one of the doors is a car. Behind two of the doors is a goat.
The player is allowed to choose any door initially. Let’s see a sample running of
the game.

Let’s say the player chooses door 1. Because there are 2 goats, either door 2 or
door 3 must have a goat behind it. The host, knowing what the right answer is,
opens up either door 2 or door 3 depending on which one had the goat behind it.
Let’s say there was a goat behind door 2. The host opens up door 2. Now there
are 2 doors remaining, door 1 and door 3. The player initially chose door 1. At
this point in the game, the player is given the option to switch doors. The player
could choose to switch to door 3 or the player could stick with door 1.
The question is this, does the player benefit from switching doors? Or does the
player have a better chance of winning by not switching doors? Or does it not
matter at all? These are the questions we are going to answer with a simulation.
